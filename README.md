# PFAS_health_metametaanalysis

Background and objective 

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals with widespread human exposure. Numerous meta-analyses have synthesised results on the association between PFAS exposure and human health; however, the evidence remains fragmented and often conflicting across compounds, outcomes, and studies. To overcome address this and derive broader insights, we conducted a second-order meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesise evidence from published meta-analyses and assess the overall strength and consistency of associations between PFAS exposure and human health outcomes. 

Code for this analysis is presented in the repository
