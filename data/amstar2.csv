For the pooled analysis, if risk estimates derived from the highest level of exposure versus the reference level were not available, risk estimates for per-unit change in each analyte were extracted. When risk estimates were available for groups of chemicals, for instance, PCB congeners, we used the summed risk estimates. Otherwise, we selected indicator congeners, such as PCB-153, to reflect the levels of all respective congeners. Publication bias was evaluated with funnel plot. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses in our study. Ï‡2-Q statistics and I 2 statistics were used to assess heterogeneity, with I 2 >50% indicating heterogeneity.

When different Î²/RR/OR values for different percentiles, tertiles, or quartiles of PFOA instead of continuous trends were provided in included studies, the strongest association with the outcome (worst-case scenario) was selected [21]. The effect sizes were pooled using the inverse variance method for random-effects meta-analysis [22].

I 2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were considered as low, medium, and high heterogeneity, respectively [23]. A random-effects model was used to summarize data to reduce the impact of heterogeneity between studies [22]. Subgroup analyses were carried out by effect size, measurement timing, geographical region, gender and with or without adjustment of maternal parity and birth weight to explore possible sources of heterogeneity.

Using the heterogeneity statistic I 2 , heterogeneity was assessed between studies. According to 25, 50, or 75%, heterogeneity (I2 ) values were classified as low, medium, or high respectively. If the I 2 â‰¥ 50, indicated significant inconsistency, a random-effect model was selected (Julian Higgins et al., 2021). To identify the source of heterogeneity, further we performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies one by one to examine the influence of each individual study in the pooled result. The study results were mentioned as stable if it is not changing by excluding the studies and if it is changing it is mentioned as unstable. After excluding certain studies from each analysis there is an attenuated association observed in the estimates. All calculations were shown on the natural log scale. A funnel plot and eggerâ€™s test were used to assess publication bias. If the number of included studies was less than five, publication bias would not be assessed.
